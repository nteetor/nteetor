### Hello hello

My name's Nathan (Nate) Teetor! I'm an R package developer and aspiring farmer. I live near-ish the city of Himeji. These days my R projects are mostly related to [{shiny}](https://github.com/rstudio/shiny). Much of my consulting work is building applications with shiny. So, to improve my workflow and hopefully others' too I am developing a suite of tools for building shiny applications. 

### Achievements

* Creator of the {zeallot} package, later invited into the [r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib) organization
* Guest on the Shiny Developer Series, [Episode 8](https://shinydevseries.com/post/episode-8-yonder/)
* Presenter at rstudio::conf(2018)

### Only for fun

* I can't get enough of [The Wise Man's Fear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wise_Man%27s_Fear)
* Favorite author is most likely Ursula K. Le Guin
* Top 200 Feral Tank (üêª)
* I wish I'd read/watched Hunter x Hunter sooner
